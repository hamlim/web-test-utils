# web-test-utils

A helpful utility for testing web applications end to end, without instrumenting the application itself.

> Test your application like real users do!

## Getting Started:

- Run `bun install` (if you don't have bun installed locally, refer to their [docs](https://bun.sh))
- Start writing some code!

## Tasks:

Since this is a `turborepo` monorepo, you can run some tasks across the repo with ease by using the configured "tasks" from the root `package.json` and `turbo.json` files. Currently the below tasks are supported:

- `build`
- `type-check`
- `lint`
- `format`
- `test`

## Tools:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- [Turborepo](https://turbo.dev/repo/docs)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [SWC](https://swc.rs/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [dprint](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [oxlint](https://oxc-project.github.io/docs/guide/usage/linter.html)

## Future Enhancements:

- Add an E2E example setup
- Add publish config to a package
